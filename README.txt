This is a demo to show the difference in execution speed from FLASH and RAM on Texas Instrument's C2000 Launchpad Kit (LAUNCHXL-F28027).

The demo executes different CPU-heavy functions, that were placed in FLASH or RAM, and prints their execution time as well as results.
The demo functions compute fibonacci numbers up to some set limit.

It is worth noting, that different results are expected, while using different optimization options!

CPU runs at max clock, 60 MHz
UART runs at 3750000 (3.75 MHz) baud rate

Results are in RESULTS.txt.

Enjoy,
Mikolaj Stawiski
